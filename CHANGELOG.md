# Changelog

## 2026-06-24

### Added

- Homepage QQ card now uses the user-provided `xian-game-icon-256.png` asset under `web/frontend-react/public/assets`.
- `WebRunner.record()` includes the current character age in readable events so the chronicle timeline can infer display years from gameplay state.
- Frontend contract checks for the image-based QQ icon, the fate summary-card structure, and chronicle year-prefix cleanup.
- Project-status notes in `docs/PROJECT_AUDIT.md`, `docs/UI_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`, and `docs/INDEX.md` for the current UI batch, validation results, and browser-validation boundary.

### Changed

- Character creation fate groups use the approved plan A summary-card collapse design: selected item pill, color dot, chevron, one open group at a time, and internally scrolling option lists.
- Game chronicle rendering treats the card title year as authoritative and strips leading `玄历/玄元历...年` prefixes from narrative text.
- Narrator prompt now tells the model not to start each event body with a chronicle year prefix.
- Browser validation guidance now prefers Chrome DevTools MCP or external Chrome because the Codex in-app browser is unstable on this machine.
- FastAPI session endpoints now share one service-error wrapper for `KeyError` / `PermissionError` / `ValueError`, preserving the existing 404 / 403 / 400 response behavior while removing repeated route boilerplate.
- SQLite and PostgreSQL catalog seeding, catalog-row JSON preparation, and player-progress summaries now share helpers in `web/backend/database_common.py`, reducing duplicate data-layer logic without changing schema or API behavior.
- Game chronicle year/text shaping moved from `GamePage.tsx` into pure helpers in `web/frontend-react/src/lib/chronicle.ts`, keeping the page focused on rendering and interaction wiring.
- Chronicle year display now uses the strongest positive year candidate from event year, turn index, inferred turn, and age-year. This prevents local fallback events with unchanged character age from leaving turn 1 displayed as `玄元历 1 年`.
- Randomized character attributes now render as read-only meters instead of disabled manual sliders, so values above the manual cap remain visible and accessible without mismatched slider semantics.
- `WebGameService.choose()` and `WebGameService.act()` now share the same private turn-advance helper, keeping turn execution, settled-turn persistence, session persistence, and response shaping in one path.
- Alpha review and game-mode spec now align the production gate with Alembic head `20260622_0004` and the completed local Chrome/account/live-model validation coverage.

### Verification

- `python -m compileall -q src tests web scripts migrations` clean.
- `pytest -q tests\web` -> 49 passed, 1 skipped (`TEST_DATABASE_URL` not configured).
- `pytest -q` -> 425 passed, 1 skipped.
- `npm run build` passed; frontend contract test `tests\web\test_frontend_contract.py` passed 16 tests.
- `pytest -q tests\web\test_web_api.py::test_web_api_minimum_game_flow tests\web\test_web_api.py::test_session_routes_map_service_errors` -> 9 passed; the minimum flow now covers both `/choice` and `/action` turn persistence.
- Documentation consistency check: `rg` now routes production acceptance to Alembic head `20260622_0004`, while local Chrome/account/live-model coverage is separated from still-open production account/model smoke.
- Chrome desktop and 375px mobile smoke passed for guest start, fallback continuation, A/B/C/D visibility, and `玄元历 2 年 · 回合 1` after the first local fallback turn.
- Chrome 375px random-character smoke confirmed all six randomized attributes expose meters whose `aria-valuenow` matches the visible value.
- Chrome desktop local account smoke passed with a temporary SQLite database and local-only invite: register/login, account new game, save to `slot_1`, load from `slot_1`, and `/api/saves` returning the saved row all completed with HTTP 200.
- Chrome 2560x1440 emulation smoke passed for home, character creation, and initial game view. No horizontal overflow was detected; the creation panels, start button, game grid, status rail, story panel, and A/B/C/D buttons stayed within the viewport.
- Chrome local live-model smoke passed with a temporary SQLite database and non-secret environment-presence check only: guest start plus choice A returned `/api/sessions/{id}/choice` HTTP 200, `fallback_prompt.active=false`, turn count 1, refreshed narrative, and refreshed A/B/C/D choices.
- Server read-only validation confirmed public health/catalog and container health, but production Alembic is still `20260621_0002` and v5 tables `game_runs`, `game_turns`, `player_progress` are missing.

## 2026-06-23

### Added

- `rarityToColor` / `colorLabel` helpers in `web/frontend-react/src/lib/util.ts` map legacy/internal rarity or grade strings into the unified 6-color palette (白/绿/蓝/紫/橙/红).
- CSS classes `.rarity-white`, `.rarity-green`, `.rarity-blue`, `.rarity-orange` in `styles.css`, alongside the existing `.rarity-purple` and `.rarity-red`.
- Contract-test assertions in `tests/web/test_frontend_contract.py` covering the homepage eyebrow removal, the short brand label `jiayp`, the 6 palette colors, the lifespan `remaining/cap` display, and the front-end reading `character.remaining_lifespan`.
- Project docs `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/USER_TUTORIAL.md` registered in `docs/INDEX.md`.
- UI background generation prompts in `docs/UI_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` for the homepage and character-creation screens.
- Contract checks for the homepage `仙` QQ mark, removal of the title red dot, centered homepage buttons, collapsible catalog groups, and the age-based `凡人长寿` rule.

### Changed

- Homepage (`HomePage.tsx`) drops the eyebrow line `WEB · 文字修仙模拟器` and the four-button descriptive paragraph; the brand link in `main.tsx` shortens to `jiayp` (the underlying URL `https://www.jiayp2917.xyz/` is preserved).
- `styles.css` removes the `.brand::after` jade dot, trims `.home` / `.home-shell` / `.home-preview` / `.hero` spacing so the page fits in a 1080p viewport.
- Character-creation `<option>` labels now render as `${name} · ${rarityToColor}`; the same colored dot is drawn on the host `<label>` because native `<option>` cannot host CSS consistently across browsers.
- Game-page choices are tighter: `.choice-list button` min-height 76 → 60 px, A/B/C/D badge 32 → 28 px; mobile breakpoint 58 → 56 px.
- `GamePage` reads `character.remaining_lifespan` first (fallback `lifespan - age`, clamped by `Math.min`); the summary now shows `${remainingLifespan}/${lifespanMax} 年`, matching `StatLine`.
- Source comments and docstrings in `death_rewards.py`, `game_engine.py`, `game_session.py`, and `game/__init__.py` no longer reference the removed combat / persistence modules.
- Homepage title stays on one line, the title red dot is removed, entry text is centered independently of the left icon, and the QQ badge now displays `仙`.
- Character-creation catalog groups are collapsible with internal scrolling; selected markers moved to the start of each row and the high-contrast rarity hint pills were replaced with plain helper text.
- `凡人长寿` now requires actual character age `>= 80` instead of using the lifespan cap; `/api/sessions/{id}/death_summary` prefers a live session recomputation before falling back to persisted rows.
- `README.md` now links to `docs/UI_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` instead of the removed `docs/WEB_ITERATION_PLAN.md`.

### Removed

- `src/agens_novel/game/combat.py` remnants in git history plus the dead `config/prompts/system/combat_narrator.md`.
- Empty `src/agens_novel/persistence/` shell and its leftover `__pycache__/`.
- `docs/WEB_ITERATION_PLAN.md` (superseded by `RUNTIME_FLOW.md` and `PROJECT_AUDIT.md`).
- Android APK skill `.agents/skills/build-apk/` (out of scope for the Web-only project).
- One-off Playwright smoke scripts under `web/frontend-react/.tmp/`.
- Redundant `.venv311/` Python 3.14 virtual environment alongside the active `.venv/`.
- Orphaned `__pycache__/*.pyc` files whose `.py` source had already been removed.
- Local `runtime/uvicorn-local.{err,out}.log` files.

### Verification

- `python -m compileall -q src tests web` clean.
- `pytest -q` → 466 passed, 1 skipped (no regressions).
- `npm run build` → 1590 modules, 15.18 kB CSS, 179.71 kB JS.
